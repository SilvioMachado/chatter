I decided to learn a bit about WebSockets. Here's something i'm working on to improve my front-end skills and my WebSocketery.

Stack:
  - React
  - Micronaut ( Kotlin )
  - PosgreSQL

### chatter

Front-end using react to log-in, send and receive text messages.

### chatter-server

Micronaut Backend to use Server Side Socketery and access users in the databse.

### For the future

- Have a decent UI
- Deploy and have automated deploy
- Implement some decent security, or at least better than plain-text password
- ...
